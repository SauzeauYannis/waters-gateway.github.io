========================

This is the website of the WWTF funded project LS19-013, collaboration between the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU), the University of Vienna, and TU Wien.

This site was built from Guillaume Th√©roux-Rancourt's [website](https://gitlab.com/gtrancourt/gtrancourt.gitlab.io), which is itself a customisation of [Steven V. Miller's theme](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template) and following his detailled instructions on [how to build a Jekyll site for academics](http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/08/create-your-website-in-jekyll/), with additional page layout tweaks inspired by [Matthew Lincoln's](http://matthewlincoln.net/) theme for his [research](http://matthewlincoln.net/projects) page.

Feel free to use.
