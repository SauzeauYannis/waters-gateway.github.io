Welcome to the *Water's gateway to heaven*, a research project bridging plant biology, 3D imaging, and computer science funded through the *Life Sciences* programme on *Multimodal Imaging* of the [Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF)](https://wwtf.at/index.php?lang=EN). The project is a collaboration between three viennese universities: plant ecophysiologists and anatomists at the [University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences](https://boku.ac.at/en/dib/institut-fuer-botanik-botany), plant cell biologists at the [University of Vienna](https://mosys.univie.ac.at/), and computer scientists expert in pattern recognition and image analysis at the [Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien)](https://www.prip.tuwien.ac.at).
